# Evaluation Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for evaluating the trained models and analyzing results in the WebOrdering_Automation system. These notebooks implement comprehensive evaluation and analysis of model performance.

## Contents

- `ablation_study.ipynb` - Notebook for conducting ablation studies
- `benchmark_results.ipynb` - Notebook for analyzing benchmark results
- `case_studies.ipynb` - Notebook for detailed case study analysis
- `error_analysis.ipynb` - Notebook for analyzing model errors

## Overview

The evaluation notebooks implement the process of assessing trained models against various benchmarks and baselines. They provide detailed analysis of model performance, including success rates, error patterns, and comparative analysis.

## Process

The notebooks in this directory:
1. Evaluate trained models on benchmark tasks
2. Conduct ablation studies to understand component contributions
3. Analyze error patterns and failure cases
4. Generate visualizations and statistical summaries
5. Compare against baseline approaches

## Dependencies

These notebooks require the project dependencies to be installed and access to trained models and evaluation datasets.
