# Preprocessing Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing collected and annotated trajectory data. These notebooks prepare the data for training machine learning models in the WebOrdering_Automation system.

## Contents

- `build_training_data.ipynb` - Notebook for building training datasets
- `embedding_analysis.ipynb` - Notebook for analyzing embeddings and representations

## Overview

The preprocessing notebooks implement the transformation of annotated trajectory data into formats suitable for training machine learning models. This includes feature extraction, data cleaning, and dataset construction.

## Process

The notebooks in this directory:
1. Transform annotated trajectories into training-ready formats
2. Extract relevant features from the trajectory data
3. Build training datasets for different model components
4. Analyze embeddings and representations used in the models

## Dependencies

These notebooks require the project dependencies to be installed and work with the annotated data generated in the previous stage.
