This directory contains LaTeX table definitions and data for tables used in the research paper describing the WebOrdering_Automation system. These tables present quantitative results and comparisons.

## Contents

- `ablation_results.tex` - Table showing ablation study results
- `annotation_quality.tex` - Table showing annotation quality metrics
- `baseline_comparison.tex` - Table comparing against baseline approaches
- `benchmark_results.tex` - Table showing benchmark performance
- `dataset_statistics.tex` - Table showing dataset statistics

## Overview

The tables directory contains structured data and LaTeX code for presenting quantitative results in the paper. These tables summarize experimental results, comparisons with baselines, and other important metrics.

## Table Categories

- **Ablation results**: Showing the contribution of different system components
- **Quality metrics**: Showing annotation and data quality measures
- **Baseline comparisons**: Comparing the system against baseline approaches
- **Benchmark results**: Showing performance on standard benchmarks
- **Dataset statistics**: Providing information about the collected datasets

## Usage

These tables are included in the LaTeX paper document and provide quantitative evidence supporting the paper's claims. They are typically generated using scripts in the `scripts/paper/` directory.
