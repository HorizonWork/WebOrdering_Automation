# Data Collection Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for collecting raw trajectory data for the WebOrdering_Automation project. These notebooks implement the data collection pipeline that gathers examples of web ordering tasks.

## Contents

- `collect_demo.ipynb` - Notebook for collecting demonstration trajectories
- `dataset_statistics.ipynb` - Notebook for analyzing dataset statistics
- `validate_raw.ipynb` - Notebook for validating raw trajectory data

## Overview

The data collection notebooks implement the process of gathering raw trajectories from web ordering tasks. These trajectories serve as the foundation for training and evaluation of the automation system.

## Process

The notebooks in this directory:
1. Collect raw interaction trajectories from web ordering tasks
2. Validate the collected data for completeness and quality
3. Generate statistics about the collected dataset

## Dependencies

These notebooks require the project dependencies to be installed and may need access to specific websites for data collection. They may also require specific browser configurations or profiles to work correctly.
